Software Security

Artemis Financial is a fictional financial institution looking to expand their online presence. Our company handles software security. Since Artemis Financial is an institution that has to adhere to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as it generally being in their best interest to protect consumer data, security is a major concern for them. 

Two things I thought I did well when assessing the clientâ€™s software for security vulnerabilities was OWASP static testing and visual inspection of the code. With the testing, I was able to read through the dependency report for vulnerabilities and either address them by updating the dependency versions or suppress them as false positives. With the visual inspections I was able to identify problem areas such as taking in untrusted data and using default values.

The biggest challenge with the vulnerability assessment was working through new material. I spent a lot of time reading through various sources so that my finished product would be solid. 

I increased levels of security by doing OWASP static testing, visual inspection for security threats and logic, and researching and employing an appropriate hashing algorithm. I would use all these tools again in the future to assess vulnerabilities, as well as the skills I developed in researching software security techniques applicable to the task at hand.

After refactoring the code I ensured it was functional and secure by running all the tests again to ensure there were no vulnerabilities and the program was working as intended.
Some resources I used that might be helpful in the future were _Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications_ by Manico and Detlefson, StackOverflow, a number of other class resources, and Google.

From this assignment I would show employers that I am aware of various security threats and how to mitigate them. This includes injections attacks, denial of service, and OWASP static testing.
